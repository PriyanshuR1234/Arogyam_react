        patientName: "Mrs. Priya Verma",
        age: "42",
        condition: "Ruptured Brain Aneurysm",
        summary: "Mrs. Priya Verma's life-saving journey through our advanced Neuro-ICU intervention.",
        fullStory: "It was a regular Tuesday evening when Mrs. Priya Verma collapsed in her kitchen with a blinding headache. Her family, terrified and unsure of what was happening, immediately suspected a stroke. Time was critical. Within minutes of the incident, her condition began to deteriorate rapidly, with slurred speech and loss of consciousness.",
        doctorContribution: "Dr. R.S. Gupta and his neurosurgical team were alerted immediately via the Arogyam emergency network. Upon arrival, they performed a minimally invasive endovascular coiling procedure. This advanced technique allowed them to seal the aneurysm without opening the skull, significantly reducing recovery time and risk.",

        arogyamImpact: "The family used the Arogyam App's 'Emergency SOS' feature. This instantly located the nearest hospital with an available Neuro-ICU bed and a neurosurgeon on call. While the ambulance was en route, the app transmitted Mrs. Verma's vitals to the hospital, allowing the team to prep the OT before she even arrived. This saved 45 crucial minutes—the difference between life and death."

        patientName: "Mr. Rajesh Patel",
        age: "55",
        condition: "Severe Sepsis & Septic Shock",
        summary: "How 55-year-old Mr. Patel fought a critical infection with our dedicated intensive care team.",
        fullStory: "Mr. Patel had been ignoring a persistent fever for days until he became disoriented and his blood pressure plummeted. He was rushed to a local clinic, but they lacked the facilities to handle septic shock. His organs were beginning to shut down, and his family was told he needed immediate dialysis and advanced life support.",
        doctorContribution: "The Critical Care team at Sanjeevni Hospital, led by Dr. Anjali Desai, implemented the 'Surviving Sepsis' protocol immediately. They placed him on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and targeted antibiotic therapy based on rapid culture results.",

        arogyamImpact: "Finding an ICU bed with CRRT capability is notoriously difficult. Mr. Patel's son used Arogyam's 'Bed Finder' feature, which showed real-time availability at Sanjeevni Hospital. The app also allowed them to upload his initial reports from the clinic, so the receiving team knew exactly what equipment to have ready. The seamless transfer coordinated by Arogyam prevented fatal delays."

        summary: "Mrs. Shalini Rao's incredible recovery powered by advanced dialysis and teamwork.",
        fullStory: "Mrs. Rao, a known diabetic, developed a severe reaction to a new medication, triggering acute liver failure followed by kidney shutdown. Her condition was complex, requiring the expertise of hepatologists, nephrologists, and intensivists working in perfect sync.",
        doctorContribution: "A multi-disciplinary board was convened within an hour of her admission. Dr. Mehta (Hepatology) and Dr. Singh (Nephrology) devised a concurrent treatment plan involving plasma exchange and dialysis. Their synchronized approach stabilized her metabolic state enough to allow her liver to regenerate naturally.",

        arogyamImpact: "Arogyam's 'Second Opinion' AI analyzed Mrs. Rao's symptoms and suggested a drug-induced reaction, prompting the family to seek a multi-specialty hospital instead of a general one. Furthermore, Arogyam's insurance integration team handled all the paperwork instantly, allowing the family to focus entirely on Mrs. Rao without the stress of financial approvals during the critical golden hour."
